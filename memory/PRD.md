# TuranEliteLimo — Product Requirements Document (Live)

> Last refreshed: Jun 4, 2026 (Feb 2026 development context)

## Original Problem Statement
Build a fully functioning website + native iOS/Android mobile app for TuranEliteLimo (premium chauffeur service, Bay Area). Stack: React + FastAPI + MongoDB + Expo React Native. Features: dynamic pricing, Stripe checkout, admin dashboard, driver live tracking. Recently expanded to: 2026 FIFA World Cup surge ops, custom invoices for affiliate brokered trips, social logins (Apple + Google).

## Live Production
- **Web:** `https://turanelitelimo.com` (deployed via Emergent)
- **iOS:** Live on App Store. TestFlight `v1.1.0 build 41` submitted Jun 4 with Apple + Google Sign-In.
- **Android:** Closed Testing on Play Console (Build #23).

## Recent Changes (this session)
- ✅ **P1: Split Google Ads conversions + marketing opt-in** — Jun 6, 2026
  - Created `/app/frontend/src/lib/googleAdsEvents.js` with `trackQuoteRequest`, `trackPhoneCall`, `trackBeginCheckout`, `trackPurchase`
  - Wired Lead conversion to QuoteRequestDialog form submit
  - Wired Phone Call conversion to Navbar, Footer, FleetPicker, PayBooking, QuoteRequestDialog phone taps
  - Wired Begin Checkout conversion to PayBooking when booking loaded but not yet paid
  - Refactored existing GoogleAdsConversion.jsx to delegate to trackPurchase helper
  - Added env placeholders: REACT_APP_GADS_LABEL_LEAD/PHONE_CALL/BEGIN_CHECKOUT/PURCHASE (user fills in after creating conversion actions in Google Ads)
  - Backend: BookingCreate now accepts `marketing_opt_in: bool`; on opt-in, upserts into new `email_opt_ins` collection with timestamp + IP for CAN-SPAM audit
  - Backend: GET /api/admin/email-list (admin only) — returns master opted-in recipients list
  - Backend: POST /api/email/unsubscribe (public, no-auth) — honors unsubscribe immediately
  - Frontend: BookingForm has "Send me occasional offers..." checkbox under wait-time-consent (default OFF — CAN-SPAM compliant)
- ✅ **Apple Sign-In FIXED + Profile-completion gate** — Jun 4, 2026
  - Deleted stale May 21 Expo iOS credentials, generated fresh cert/profile with Apple Sign-In entitlement
  - Pinned `expo-apple-authentication@8.0.8` (was 56.0.4, incompatible with SDK 54)
  - Backend `verify_apple_id_token`: fixed audience-list bug (python-jose requires string, not list)
  - Backend `_login_or_link_social`: skip soft-deleted customers; drop stale oauth_identities
  - Backend `customer_delete_account`: also detach oauth_identities so re-sign-in creates fresh account
  - Backend `customer_book_and_pay`: validates rider has real name+phone on file before allowing booking
  - Mobile pay.tsx: shows "Complete your profile" gate before payment when name/phone missing
  - iOS Build #43 live on TestFlight with all the above mobile changes
  - Backend changes need a **Deploy** to push to production

## Persona & Architecture (unchanged)
See `/app/memory/CHANGELOG.md` for full feature changelog and `/app/memory/ROADMAP.md` for backlog.

## P0/P1 Backlog (After Apple Sign-In v1.1.0 build 41)
- **P0**: User confirms Apple Sign-In works on TestFlight build 41
- **P0**: Sacramento affiliate sourcing for "Cristina" lead (advise re-quote at $895 to absorb $750 affiliate cost)
- **P1**: Re-add Push Notifications setup on next iOS build (skipped today; requires Apple account password, not app-specific)
- **P1**: Deploy web updates (Affiliates tab, Invoices tab, World Cup page, Smart App Banner) to production via Emergent Deploy
- **P2**: Add real photos for 3 new Sprinter trims (Standard, Executive, Jet) once user provides
- **P2**: iOS v1.1 build 41 App Store submission (if user wants to ship publicly)

## P3 Future
- Saved Addresses (Home/Work) for riders → one-tap rebooking
- Rename "Book" bottom-tab to "Home", add back button on booking page
- In-app Settings page (notifications, change password, delete account)
- Tech debt: Split `server.py` (>7,200 lines) into modular routers
- "Refer a Friend" $25 credit
- Apple Sign-In for Android (web-redirect flow)

## Credentials & Secrets (do NOT commit)
- Apple ID for EAS auth: `abdulkhafizfayzullaev@gmail.com` (app-specific password user-generated per session)
- Apple Team ID: `X5PCWL9H76`
- ASC API Key on disk: `/app/mobile/AuthKey_S6ZN2K2TN4.p8` (key ID `S6ZN2K2TN4`, issuer `c7a389fa-d6e1-43d5-b2d6-3a5048e85f31`)
- ASC App ID: `6771610380`
- EXPO_TOKEN: rotated per session — user creates new one on https://expo.dev/settings/access-tokens

## Known State

- `/app/mobile/src/components/SocialSignInButtons.tsx` — Apple button rendering logic (already in place)
- Expo Credentials (server-side) — wiped May 21, regenerated Jun 4
