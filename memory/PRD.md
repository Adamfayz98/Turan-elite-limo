## Changelog — May 21 2026 (this session, continued)

### 🗺️ FIX (TAKE 2): Map "This page can't load Google Maps correctly" — ROOT CAUSE FOUND
**Why the first fix failed:** Changing WebView `baseUrl` to `turanelitelimo.com` did NOT actually change the HTTP Referer header that iOS WebView sends to Google. Per react-native-webview docs, iOS WKWebView does not reliably send the Referer header for HTML content loaded via `source={{ html }}`. The Google Maps JS API was rejecting the request because no/wrong referrer was reaching it.

**Real fix:** Created a NEW unrestricted Google Maps API key (`AIzaSyCDlQDr5_EYzX_qQpFgFqUZe6yQa7p9T7A`) in Google Cloud Console for the TuranEliteLimo project with:
- Application restrictions: **None** (no HTTP referrer restriction — required for WebView)
- API restrictions: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API, Directions API
- Billing now enabled on the project (user just linked billing account)

**Ship:**
- iOS build #13 (`58e45020-0343-4ffb-baa5-1b37ee7112d5`) submitted to TestFlight (submission `fbe2830f`). 
- Android build #7 (`b8e0dc60-b56d-4062-bff2-7a522527bef1`) finished — `.aab` at https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/oQ7EKwWR492JwB5VSkdnSr.aab — waiting on Google Play service account JSON for auto-submit.
- Mobile web preview at `/m/` rebuilt with new key and verified via curl — server returns `AIzaSyCDl...`, old key removed.

**Verification:** Direct curl tests of Maps JS API, Geocoding API, and Places API with the new key all succeed.

### 🤖 FIX: Android EAS build failing (4 prior errors — root causes resolved)
**Root cause A:** `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^3.0.3` has a new Android-side dependency `org.asyncstorage.shared_storage:storage-android:1.0.0` that is not published to public Maven repositories. Gradle could not resolve it; build failed at `:app:mergeReleaseNativeLibs`.

**Root cause B:** Many `expo-*` packages were on version 55.x while the project is on Expo SDK 54 — Kotlin compilation of `expo-updates:compileReleaseKotlin` failed with "`onDidCreateReactHost` overrides nothing" because the 55.x packages expected newer React Native host APIs. iOS tolerated this; Android did not.

**Fix:**
1. Downgraded `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` from `^3.0.3` → `2.2.0` (Expo SDK 54-compatible).
2. Realigned all expo packages to SDK 54 via `expo install`: `expo-device@~8.0.10`, `expo-haptics@~15.0.8`, `expo-location@~19.0.8`, `expo-notifications@~0.32.17`, `expo-secure-store@~15.0.8`, `expo-updates@~29.0.17`, `expo-web-browser@~15.0.11`, `react-native-webview@13.15.0`, `@react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.4.4`.

**Result:** Android build #6 (`f3046e50-3b45-4f46-8979-bb4b14b8fd70`, versionCode 6) FINISHED — `.aab` available at https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/w1vDzeuzDETkz5ioKJAT7q.aab. Ready to submit to Google Play Console.

### 🎨 FIX: App icon too small + off-center on iPhone home screen
**Root cause:** Original `icon.png` had the wolf+crescent logo filling only 54% of canvas (Apple ideal: 70-85%) with center offset 70px below true center.

**Fix:** Regenerated all icon assets from `logo-mark-1024.png` (the master logo file):
- `icon.png`: logo now fills 78% of canvas, perfectly centered (511, 512)
- `adaptive-icon.png`: 70% (Android safe zone)
- `splash.png`: 40% (elegant centered on dark)

### 🐞 FIX: Mobile web preview at `/m/` returned a blank white page
**Root cause:** Expo's `expo export --platform web` generates an `index.html` that references `/_expo/...` (root) for JS, but the page is served from `/m/`, so the browser hit 404 silently.

**Fix:** Patched `/app/frontend/public/m/index.html` to use `/m/_expo/...` paths. Verified curl returns new JS bundle with the new API key.

### 🚀 NEW BUILDS shipped
- iOS #13 (`58e45020`) — first build with new API key → submitted to TestFlight
- iOS #14 (`f1f6c60e`) — has new API key + new icons → submitted to TestFlight (submission `1e5615c0`)
- Android #7 (`b8e0dc60`) — first .aab with new key: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/oQ7EKwWR492JwB5VSkdnSr.aab
- Android #8 (`eef75758`) — .aab with new key + new icons → ready for Play Console submit once user provides service account JSON

### 🔑 New Google Maps API key created
User created `AIzaSyCDlQDr5_EYzX_qQpFgFqUZe6yQa7p9T7A` under `support@turanelitelimo.com` Cloud account with:
- Application restrictions: None (required for WebView)
- API restrictions: Maps JS, Places, Geocoding, Directions
- Billing linked

### 🗺️ MAJOR REFACTOR: WebView Maps → Native Google Maps SDK (react-native-maps)
**Why:** User's previous build (#14) still showed "Can't load Google Maps correctly" error in iOS with web chrome (Keyboard shortcuts/Terms footer). Root cause is fundamental — iOS WKWebView and HTTP-referrer restrictions are not compatible. The whole WebView approach was the wrong tool for the job.

**Refactor:**
1. Installed `react-native-maps@1.20.1` (the library Uber/Lyft use).
2. Rewrote `/app/mobile/src/components/InteractiveMap.tsx` from a WebView-based component to a native `MapView` using `PROVIDER_GOOGLE`. Dark/gold luxury style applied via `customMapStyle` prop. Custom gold pickup pin, dark dropoff pin, gold polyline. Auto-fits to all visible points with 60% padding.
3. Fixed `/app/mobile/app/(rider)/(tabs)/home.tsx` — InteractiveMap now passed `height="100%"` so it actually fills the screen (was defaulting to 320px, causing the "half black, half map" layout bug).
4. Added native API key configuration in `app.json`:
   - `ios.config.googleMapsApiKey`
   - `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey`
5. User enabled Maps SDK for iOS + Maps SDK for Android in Google Cloud and added them to the existing key restrictions.

**Ship:**
- iOS build #15 (`c53199a3-a19a-42bc-9c91-b9cac62d04b9`) — submitted to TestFlight (submission `b3cf864a`). Processing on Apple's side.
- Android build #9 (`8577f9dc-4ff0-4d3a-8972-093706cf4aec`) — in progress.

```json
{
  "ascAppId": "6771610380",
  "appleTeamId": "9M7CK4W8HM"
}
```

### 🤖 Android build BLOCKED (Gradle error)
- Two attempts both failed at "Run gradlew" phase with
  `EAS_BUILD_UNKNOWN_GRADLE_ERROR`
- Logs are zstd-encoded and not viewable from container shell
- **Resolution path:** debug on a desktop with `cd mobile && eas build --platform android --profile preview --local` to see full gradle output, OR view logs in browser at
  https://expo.dev/accounts/adamfayz98/projects/turanelitelimo/builds/2400c49c-6886-4600-8989-f27916777c68
- Most likely cause: `expo-updates` was just added and may need Android-side gradle plugin config



### 🔴 P0 Fix: "Something went wrong" on Stripe checkout (the Krista root cause)
**Problem:** Customer Krista (and the user himself, reproduced on Chrome desktop)
hit `/payments/checkout` → got "Something went wrong" toast → never reached
Stripe → frustrated → cancelled the booking. Root cause was that
`window.location.href = stripeUrl` silently fails in several scenarios:
iOS Safari ITP, popup blockers, network blips between booking creation and
checkout response (booking + Stripe session got written to DB but the
client-side redirect never ran).

**Four-layer fix shipped:**
1. **Visible checkout overlay** (`CheckoutRedirectOverlay.jsx`) — replaces silent
   `window.location.href` with a full-screen "Opening secure checkout…" modal
   that triggers the redirect AND, after 2.5s of being still on the page,
   reveals a big yellow "Open secure checkout →" button with the real Stripe
   URL. Works on iOS Safari because the manual click is user-initiated.
2. **15-minute payment-recovery email** (`_send_payment_recovery_emails`) —
   APScheduler job runs every 5 min, finds any booking stuck in
   `payment_status=pending` for >15 min, sends customer a polite "looks like
   checkout got interrupted, here's a direct link" email AND texts the admin
   so they can phone the customer immediately. One-shot per booking
   (`payment_recovery_sent_at`).
3. **Server-side checkout failure tracking** — `_record_checkout_failure`
   catches Stripe timeouts/network errors/non-200s. Increments
   `checkout_failures` on the booking, logs to `checkout_failures` collection,
   AND fires an admin SMS *"⚠️ CHECKOUT FAILED · CALL THIS CUSTOMER NOW"*.
4. **Client-side telemetry** — `POST /api/payments/checkout-telemetry` logs
   redirect_blocked / manual_fallback_clicked events with user-agent so we can
   spot patterns (e.g. iOS 17 Safari blocking the redirect 30% of the time).

**Admin UI:** Bookings table now shows two extra badges in the Payment column:
- 🔵 `⏳ Nx attempt` — customer reached Stripe N times but hasn't paid
- 🟠 `⚠ N fails` — Stripe call failed N times (hover for error detail)

**Tests:** 5 backend tests all pass — telemetry endpoint, recovery job at 15min,
recovery skips <15min bookings, recovery skips cancellation-requested bookings,
real Stripe checkout creates session + stamps counters.

**Files:**
- `/app/backend/server.py` — Booking model + `/payments/checkout` hardening +
  recovery job + telemetry endpoint + admin SMS on every checkout failure
- `/app/frontend/src/components/CheckoutRedirectOverlay.jsx` — NEW
- `/app/frontend/src/components/BookingForm.jsx` — uses overlay
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/PayBooking.jsx` — uses overlay
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` — attempt/failure badges

### 🟢 Cancellation provenance + retroactive backfill (shipped earlier today)
- `cancellation_source` stamped on every cancel path
  (`admin` / `customer_web` / `mobile_app` / `auto_abandoned`)
- Admin UI badges: 🤖 / 👤 / 🧑‍💼 / ⚪ on every cancelled booking
- Forensic timestamps (`cancelled_at`, `cancelled_by_admin_email`,
  `auto_cancelled_at`, `payment_reminder_sent_at`) in BookingDetailsDialog
- `_sweep_abandoned_checkouts` background job — 72h cutoff (was 24h inline),
  with 23h "your reservation needs payment" reminder email
- `POST /admin/bookings/backfill-cancellation-source` — one-shot endpoint
  + admin UI button to retro-stamp historical cancellations

## New Backend Endpoints (mobile-only)
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | /api/customer/signup | Create rider account, returns JWT (30d) |
| POST | /api/customer/login | Email + password, returns JWT |
| GET  | /api/customer/me | Current rider profile |
| POST | /api/customer/book-and-pay | One-call: create booking + Stripe Checkout |
| GET  | /api/customer/trips | Trip history |
| GET  | /api/customer/bookings/{id} | Trip detail + auto-sync Stripe paid status |
| GET  | /api/customer/bookings/{id}/driver-location | Live driver GPS |
| POST | /api/customer/bookings/{id}/rate | 5-star rating, aggregates driver avg |
| GET  | /api/places/autocomplete | Google Places proxy (existing) |
| POST | /api/driver-auth/login | Driver email + password → JWT |
| POST | /api/driver-auth/set-password | First-time setup (driver pre-created by admin) |
| GET  | /api/driver-auth/me | Driver profile |

| GET  | /api/admin/drivers/live | All driver positions (admin) |
| POST | /api/admin/bookings/assign-driver | Alt assignment endpoint |
| GET  | /api/vehicle-types | Public fleet info |

The existing admin `assign-driver` endpoint now **auto-links** the driver record by
matching phone number, so admin-assigned trips show up in the mobile driver app.

## New DB Collections / Fields
- `customers`: id, name, email (lower), phone, password_hash (bcrypt), created_at
- `driver_locations`: driver_id, latitude, longitude, heading, speed, accuracy,
  active_booking_id, updated_at, updated_at_ts
- `bookings`: + `customer_id`, `source` (`mobile_app`), `driver_id` (linked),
  `driver_latitude`/`_longitude`/`_heading`/`_location_updated_at`,
  `rating`, `rating_comment`, `rated_at`
- `drivers`: + `password_hash`, `avg_rating`, `ratings_count`

## Session — Feb 20, 2026 (fork) — continued
**P0 Batch — Maps + Forgot Password + Promo + Driver Portal:**

Backend (`server.py`):
- NEW: `POST /api/customer/forgot-password` — Resend-sent reset email, always returns 200 to prevent user enumeration. 2-hour token.
- NEW: `POST /api/customer/reset-password` — consumes one-time token, updates password hash.
- NEW: `GET /api/driver-auth/bookings/{id}` — JWT-driver trip detail with ownership check.
- NEW: `POST /api/driver-auth/bookings/{id}/status` — JWT-driver status progression (TRIP_STATUS_ORDER guard).
- NEW: `POST /api/driver-auth/bookings/{id}/record-wait-time` — delegates to shared `_record_wait_time_for_booking`.
- NEW: `POST /api/driver-auth/bookings/{id}/record-mid-trip-stop` — delegates to shared `_record_mid_trip_stop_for_booking`.
- REFACTOR: Token-based wait-time + mid-trip-stop endpoints now also call the shared helpers (no behavior change, just DRY).

Web (`frontend/src`):
- NEW: `/reset-password` route + page (`pages/ResetPassword.jsx`).
- REWRITE: `components/admin/LiveDriversTab.jsx` now uses interactive Google Maps JS API:
  - Dark luxury theme, pan/zoom enabled, gold car icon marker
  - Click any driver row → map pans+zooms to that driver
  - "Reset view" button to clear focus and auto-fit all drivers

Mobile (`mobile/app`):
- NEW: `/(rider)/forgot.tsx` — forgot-password screen with success confirmation.
- WIRED: `auth.tsx` "Forgot password?" link now navigates to `/(rider)/forgot`.
- WIRED: `pay.tsx` promo input — calls `/api/promos/validate`, shows discount preview, sends promo on bookAndPay.
- REWRITE: `(driver)/active-trip.tsx` — full feature parity with web DriverPortal:
  - Status progression (assigned → en_route → on_location → passenger_onboard → completed)
  - Record wait time modal (minutes input → admin reviews)
  - Add mid-trip stop modal (address + minutes → detour calc, admin reviews)
  - One-tap navigate via Google Maps deep link
  - Live GPS streaming indicator
- NEW: `src/components/InteractiveMap.tsx` — cross-platform interactive Google Map (WebView on native, iframe on web), animated gold car marker.
- WIRED: Rider active-trip screen now uses InteractiveMap (replaces blurry static image).
- NEW: API helpers — customerForgotPassword, validatePromo, driverGetBookingDetail, driverUpdateBookingStatus, driverRecordWaitTime, driverRecordMidTripStop.

**Testing:**
- iteration_27.json — 20/20 passed, 2 CRITICAL bugs found in mid-trip-stop endpoint.
- iteration_28.json — 24/24 passed, all critical bugs fixed and verified. 2 minor non-blocking issues (pre-existing in token endpoints too): re-geocoding on each call (cost concern); admin dashboard field naming.

## Session — Feb 20, 2026 (fork) — continued (3rd batch)
**P0 Fixes — Admin map / Consent / Cancel trip / Stripe redirect / Pickup pin:**

Backend (`server.py`):
- NEW: `POST /api/customer/bookings/{booking_id}/cancel` (JWT-customer auth) — same business rules as the token-based endpoint; unpaid = immediate cancel, paid = `cancellation_requested` flag + admin SMS.
- FIXED: `/api/customer/book-and-pay` success_url detection — now uses User-Agent (was incorrectly checking `notes` field which mobile never sends). Browsers get the `/m/` https fallback; native apps get the `turanelitelimo://thank-you` deep link.
- ENHANCED: `/api/customer/bookings/{id}/driver-location` now lazily geocodes + caches `pickup_coord` and `dropoff_coord` on the booking, returned in the response — enables route polyline + pickup pin on the rider live-tracking map.

Web (`frontend/src`):
- FIXED: `components/admin/LiveDriversTab.jsx` — robust loading/error states (was showing blank dark canvas when Maps JS hadn't loaded). Now shows a "Loading map…" spinner, a yellow error banner if the API key is missing or restricted, and a "No drivers yet" empty-state overlay when no drivers have shared GPS.

Mobile (`mobile/app`):
- WIRED: `(rider)/(tabs)/trips.tsx` — each non-completed trip card now has a red Cancel button with a confirmation alert (different copy for paid vs unpaid).
- NEW: `(rider)/pay.tsx` — 3 mandatory consent checkboxes (wait-time, vehicle care, cancellation tier) BEFORE the Pay button activates. Pay button label flips to "Agree to policies to continue" when checkboxes are unchecked.
- ENHANCED: `(rider)/active.tsx` — rider's live-tracking map now shows the **pickup pin** (gold "A" marker) + a **dashed gold polyline** between the driver and pickup (Uber-style "driver is N min away" visualization).
- ENHANCED: `src/components/InteractiveMap.tsx` — added `showRoute` prop that draws a dashed gold polyline from driver → pickup.
- NEW: API helper `customerCancelBooking`.

**Known infrastructure issue (not a code bug):**
- Expo Go tunnel keeps failing in this container due to `ENOSPC: inotify watch limit (12288 in container, can't raise without root)`. The container's metro file watcher exhausts watches on `node_modules`. This is a platform limitation, not the app. **User can still test via web preview at /m/.** When deploying to production, this is not an issue since native bundles are built once via EAS, not watched.

**Testing:**
- iteration_29.json — 17/17 backend tests passed. 0 critical. 3 minor polish suggestions (non-blocking, deferred).

## Session — Feb 20, 2026 (fork) — 4th batch (Modify Trip)

**Backend:**
- NEW: `POST /api/customer/bookings/{id}/modify` (JWT customer). Customer can change pickup time, pickup/dropoff address, vehicle type, passenger count, or notes on UNPAID reservations. Paid bookings return 409 with "call dispatch" message.
- NEW: `CustomerModifyBookingRequest` model (all fields optional).
- Re-quotes the trip automatically when pickup/dropoff/vehicle/time changes (fixed: must `pop('quote_amount')` from merged doc or `_compute_quote_amount` short-circuits).
- Clears `pickup_coord`/`dropoff_coord` geocode cache when address changes.

**Mobile:**
- NEW: `/(rider)/modify.tsx` — full modify trip screen with AddressPicker + DateTimeModal + vehicle/passenger/notes fields. Read-only for paid trips (shows call-dispatch CTA).
- WIRED: trip cards in `(rider)/(tabs)/trips.tsx` now show **Modify** button (only for unpaid non-completed trips) next to the Cancel button.

**Testing:**
- iteration_30.json — 18 tests, 1 CRITICAL bug found (quote short-circuit).
- iteration_31.json — 23/23 passed after one-line fix. Zero critical issues. 4 minor items deferred (notes diff check, quote_recompute_failed flag, modification lead-time guard, response field naming).

## Session — Feb 20, 2026 (fork) — 5th batch (Launch Prep Phase 1)

**iOS / Android launch prep — code-side complete:**
- App icons generated from wolf logo: `icon.png` (1024 master), `adaptive-icon.png` (Android adaptive foreground), `splash.png` (2048×2048), `favicon.png`, `notification-icon.png` — all in `/app/mobile/assets/`.
- `app.json` rewritten for production:
  - Bundle id / package: `com.turanelitelimo.app`
  - Scheme: `turanelitelimo` (matches existing Stripe deep links)
  - iOS Info.plist usage descriptions for foreground + background location, camera, photo library, ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false
  - Android permissions + universal-link intent filter
  - expo-location + expo-notifications plugins configured
  - Runtime version policy: `appVersion` (enables OTA updates per-version)
- `eas.json` created — development / preview / production build profiles, internal distribution for TestFlight + Android internal testing, app-bundle output for Play Store.
- Added `expo-notifications` + `expo-device` deps (for upcoming push notifications work).

**Public legal pages (Apple/Google both require these URLs before approving the app):**
- NEW: `/privacy` — Privacy Policy page (`PrivacyPolicy.jsx`)
- NEW: `/terms` — Terms of Service page (`TermsOfService.jsx`)
- Both rendered, linked from each other, follow CCPA / GDPR essentials, name every third-party vendor (Stripe, Google Maps, Resend, SMS provider, Apple/Firebase push).

**Documentation:**
- NEW: `/app/memory/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` — step-by-step launch runway, all critical IDs to track, realistic timeline (Day 1 → Day 7 live on stores).

**Status of accounts (user-side, pending):**
- Apple Developer: APPLIED, under Apple review (~24-48h typical).
- Google Play Console: PURCHASING.
- Expo/EAS account: NOT YET CREATED.

**Next step after accounts approved:** I will run `eas init` (assigns permanent projectId), then `eas build --platform ios --profile preview` and `--platform android --profile preview` to produce TestFlight + Internal Testing builds.

## Recurrence/Known Issues
- None as of this session.
- The Expo tunnel URL (`exp://...exp.direct`) rotates whenever the Metro server restarts. Next session must restart tunnel and provide a fresh QR.

## Session — Feb 20, 2026 (fork)
**Fixed:**
- Compile-error overlay bug ("X" popup) — `LiveDriversTab.jsx` `api` import fixed.
- Fleet images: Stretch Limo, Sprinter Van, Party Bus (web + mobile).
- Admin Live Map tab orphaned — added to TabsList.

**Mobile pre-auth welcome screen v2 (`/app/mobile/app/index.tsx`):**
- Hero with logo, phone button, "Sign In" pill (top-right)
- Hero CTAs: "See pricing — no sign-up needed" (primary) + "Already have an account? Sign in" (secondary)
- Replaced "Six vehicles. One standard." → **"A class for every journey"** with network-implying subtitle
- Fleet horizontal carousel (6 vehicle types)
- Services grid (Airport / Corporate / Weddings / Hourly / Wine / Nightlife)
- Coverage (3 airports + 12 cities)
- 3 testimonial reviews
- **Policies & Trust section (NEW)** — collapsible cards: Cancellation, Wait Time & Damages, Privacy, Terms
- Footer with **website link (turanelitelimo.com)** + phone + Driver sign-in
- **Sticky bottom "Book a Ride" CTA bar** (always visible during scroll)
- Auth-aware: logged-in users skip welcome and go to `/home`

**Guest browsing flow (NEW):**
- `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` no longer redirects unauth users — guests can browse the home tab and get live quotes.
- `pay.tsx` shows a "One more step — sign in to confirm" gate for guests.
- `trips.tsx` and `profile.tsx` show "Sign in to see your X" prompts for guests.

**Logo replaced (web + mobile):**
- New logo: gold ring + howling wolf + constellation stars, with "TuranEliteLimo" wordmark.
- `/app/frontend/public/logo-mark.png` — clean 512x512 wolf-in-ring icon (cropped from user's full lockup, no wordmark spillover).
- `/app/frontend/public/logo-full.png` — full lockup (icon + wordmark).
- `/app/frontend/public/logo-mark-1024.png` — high-res variant for App Store icon prep.
- Mobile `theme.ts` `assets.logoMark/logoFull` now point to the preview URLs with cache-busting (`?v=3`).

**Confirmed (no code change needed):**
- Mobile app ↔ Admin pricing: fully connected via `/api/customer/quote` → MongoDB `PRICING_CONFIG`. Admin Pricing tab writes propagate live to mobile.

**Pending user verification:**
- Test on Expo Go (or web preview at `/m/`): new welcome screen, guest booking flow, logo correctness on real device.
